flutter:
  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true
  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # Image Assets
  assets:
    - Images/Google-flutter-logo.png
  #  - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  # To add more than one images, we need not have to require to give all the name of the picture we want to add.
  # Instead we can refer to that folder by: Images/*
  # Font Assets
  fonts:
    - family: CourierPrime-Regular
      fonts:
        - asset: Fonts/CourierPrime-Regular.ttf
  # Like wise, if want to add more than one Font, we can use the syntax we've used for Images as well by Fonts/*
